# C - More Singly Linked Lists

This project is a part of the ALX Software Engineering program. It focuses on the implementation and understanding of singly linked lists in the C programming language. The tasks in this project are designed to provide hands-on experience in working with linked lists and understanding their usage in data structures.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the following flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- The code should adhere to the Betty style, which will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- Usage of global variables is not allowed
- Each file should consist of no more than 5 functions
- Only the following C standard library functions are allowed: `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`. Usage of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc`, etc., is forbidden
- The use of `_putchar` is allowed
- Do not push `_putchar.c` as it will not be taken into account
- All header files should be include guarded

## Objectives

This project aims to achieve the following objectives:

- Understanding the usage and implementation of linked lists in C

## Tasks

The project involves the following tasks:

1. **Print list**: Write a function that prints all the elements of a listint_t list.
2. **List length**: Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked listint_t list.
3. **Add node**: Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a listint_t list.
4. **Add node at the end**: Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a listint_t list.
5. **Free list**: Write a function that frees a listint_t list.
6. **Free**: Write a function that frees a listint_t list.
7. **Pop**: Write a function that deletes the head node of a listint_t linked list and returns the head nodeâ€™s data (n).
8. **Get node at index**: Write a function that returns the nth node of a listint_t linked list.
9. **Sum list**: Write a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a listint_t linked list.
10. **Insert**: Write a function that inserts a new node at a given position.
11. **Delete at index**: Write a function that deletes the node at index index of a listint_t linked list.
