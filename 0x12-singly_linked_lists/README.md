# Singly Linked Lists Project

## Objectives

The main objective of this project is to understand and implement the concept of singly linked lists in the C programming language. By completing the tasks outlined in this project, you will gain a solid understanding of data structures, memory management, and basic algorithms.

## Requirements

- All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the following flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files should end with a new line
- The code should use the Betty style, checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- Avoid using global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`
- Allowed editor choices: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Include a `README.md` file at the root of the project folder
- The `lists.h` header file should contain the prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the `_putchar` function
- All header files should be include guarded
- Avoid pushing the `_putchar.c` file, as it will not be considered during evaluation
- Avoid any form of plagiarism, as it is strictly forbidden and may result in removal from the program

## Tasks

1. **Print list**
   - Write a function that prints all the elements of a `list_t` list.

2. **List length**
   - Write a function that returns the number of elements in a `list_t` list.

3. **Add node**
   - Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `list_t` list.

4. **Add node at the end**
   - Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a `list_t` list.

5. **Free list**
   - Write a function that frees a `list_t` list.

Additional Information:

- The project directory contains individual files for each task, numbered accordingly.
- Each C file corresponds to a specific task mentioned in the task list section.
- Ensure that all header files are include guarded to prevent multiple inclusions.
- You may use the provided `main.c` files to test your functions, but they do not need to be pushed to the repository.
