# Doubly Linked Lists Project

## Description
This project focuses on implementing and working with doubly linked lists in the C programming language. Doubly linked lists are a fundamental data structure, and this project aims to provide solutions to various tasks related to manipulating and managing doubly linked lists.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several tasks, each addressing a specific functionality related to doubly linked lists. The tasks include printing the list, calculating its length, adding nodes at the beginning and end, freeing the list, retrieving a node at a specific index, summing the data, inserting at an index, and deleting at an index.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the source code using the provided commands.
4. Execute the compiled program.

## Coding Standards
- Code should adhere to the Betty style. Ensure to run `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl` to check for compliance.
- Header files should be include guarded.

## Files
- **0-print_dlistint.c**: Print all elements of a doubly linked list.
- **1-dlistint_len.c**: Return the number of elements in a doubly linked list.
- **2-add_dnodeint.c**: Add a new node at the beginning of a doubly linked list.
- **3-add_dnodeint_end.c**: Add a new node at the end of a doubly linked list.
- **4-free_dlistint.c**: Free a doubly linked list.
- **5-get_dnodeint.c**: Return the nth node of a doubly linked list.
- **6-sum_dlistint.c**: Return the sum of all elements in a doubly linked list.
- **7-insert_dnodeint.c**: Insert a new node at a given position in the list.
- **8-delete_dnodeint.c**: Delete the node at a specified index in the doubly linked list.
- **lists.h**: Header file containing function prototypes and the doubly linked list structure.
