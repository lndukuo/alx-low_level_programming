# C - Bit Manipulation

This project focuses on understanding and implementing bit manipulation and bitwise operators in the C programming language. The tasks included in this project are designed to enhance your understanding of bitwise operations and their applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Look for the right sources of information for bit manipulation with minimal assistance
- Implement various bitwise operations in C
- Explain the concept of bit manipulation to others without external help

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the following flags: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files should end with a new line
- Include a README.md file at the root of the project folder
- Use the Betty style for your code
- Avoid the use of global variables
- Each file should contain no more than 5 functions
- Use only the C standard library functions malloc, free, and exit. Avoid using functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc, etc.
- Remember to include the prototypes of all your functions in the header file called main.h
- Ensure all header files are include guarded
